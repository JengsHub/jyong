          This project was a collaborative effort from two teams, one based in
          Malaysia and the other in Australia. The goal here was to create a
          system to assist with assigning tutors to classes for Monash
          University Australia. The project idea was pitched to us due to the
          fact that the existing process of allocating tutors were "troublesome"
          per se.

          This project was started from scratch. Therefore the first meeting
          with our stakeholders were crucial for the Product Management Team to
          nail the product vision statement by understanding the needs and
          requirements for the application. We had also come up with a
          conceptual class diagram that consists of important domain concepts.
          Below is an example of the conceptual class diagram we came up with.

          With the Class Diagram done, we then had to decide the framework and
          tools we will be using for the project. We decided its best to utilize
